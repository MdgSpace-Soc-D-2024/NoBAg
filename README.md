## *Impact*
By simplifying project management processes, NoBAg enhances productivity and reduces inefficiencies, allowing
teams to focus on high-value tasks instead of unnecessary serfing through internet. It justifies its name NoBAg
which means no to something which you can carry implies no backlog as NoBAg will make your work so seamless
which will prevent creation of backlog.

## *Why term NoBAg*
Bag implies something which you carry with you. Backlog is something which when created we have to carry
irrespective of our choice. Hence NoBAg means now you don’t have to carry anything whether its a bag of backlog.
